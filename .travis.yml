# use VM infrastructure on Travis
# exit code 137 indicates that your build is now taking more memory
# or rather it's running alongside other builds requiring a lot of memory.
# This can happen because your builds are running on container-based infrastructure and they will share the host's 4 GB memory.
# To mitigate this situation, run your builds on our sudo-enabled Precise infrastructure.
# Over there, your builds will run on a fully independent VM with 7.5 GB of (unshared) memory.
