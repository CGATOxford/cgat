Release Notes
=============

The code collection is under continuous improvement and the 
latest code can always be found in the code repository.
Nevertheless, we occasionally prepare releases. Notes on
each release are below.

Release 0.2.5
=============

Minor bugfix release to ensure compatibility with pysam >= 0.8.4

Release 0.2.4
=============

Minor bugfix release to ensure compatibility with pysam 0.8.4

Release 0.2.3
=============

Minor release to ensure compatibility with pysam-0.8.1

Release 0.2.2
=============

We have reviewed the command line options in all of the CGAT
scripts and have changed them to make them more consistent
between tools and more informative on the command line. This
means that existing scripts that call CGAT tools need to be
updated. A table with all options used in scripts and how
they have or have not changed 
`here <https://github.com/CGATOxford/cgat/blob/master/tests/option_list.tsv>`_.

There is a script called `cgat_refactor.py
<https://github.com/CGATOxford/cgat/blob/master/refactor/cgat_refactor.py>`_
to facilicate refactoring the repository. Instructions on how to use
the script are given at the command line help.

3rd party code
==============

The CGAT code collection has been made possible by the many developers
in the bioinformatics and python community that have made their code
available for sharing. The code collection includes some snippets of
code taken from elsewhere for convenience, most notably:

1. IGV.py from Brent Petersen 
   https://github.com/brentp/bio-playground/blob/master/igv/igv.py

2. Nested containment list from the Pygr project
   http://code.google.com/p/pygr/

3. SVGdraw.py was written by Fedor Baart & Hans de Wit

4. list_overlap.py from Brent Petersen
   https://github.com/brentp/bio-playground/blob/master/utils/list_overlap_p.py

5. Iterators.py from an unknown source.
